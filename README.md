# Extended To-Do Application

This is an extended to-do application developed as part of the Computer Networks and Distributed Systems course at Copenhagen Business School. The application is designed to showcase advanced concepts in network communication, scalability, and distributed system design. It includes several key features like email notifications via Nodemailer and rate limiting for secure and efficient access control.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, update, delete, and view tasks.
- **Email Notifications**: Task-related notifications (e.g., reminders) are sent using Nodemailer.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects the server from being overwhelmed by limiting the number of requests using a rate limiter.
- **User Authentication**: Basic authentication implemented to ensure secure access to tasks.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is accessible across different devices with an optimized UI.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Email**: Nodemailer
- **Security**: Rate limiting for API requests
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## For at køre programmet skal du gøre følgende:

Skrive $`npm run full-install` i terminalen.
**_ Bemærk at serveren godt kan tage lidt tid at starte, serveren virker først når `Server is listening on PORT : 3007..` forekommer i terminalen _**
